# **HR Management System (PostgreSQL Project)**  

## **📌 Introduction**  
This project is a **SQL-based HR Management System**, where I have designed a database and executed various queries to manage employee records, payroll, attendance, and more.  

I learned **PostgreSQL** from **Jose Portilla’s Udemy course**, and I sincerely thank him for the valuable knowledge shared. This project is done purely for **course completion satisfaction** and to apply what I have learned in a practical way.  

All SQL commands, queries, and database structures are **designed and written by me** based on the knowledge gained from the course.  

To populate tables that required a large amount of data, I used Python along with various modules such as pandas, faker, and csv to generate and insert realistic test data efficiently.

## **📂 About the Database**  
This project simulates a **Human Resource (HR) Management System** where an organization can manage its employees efficiently. The database consists of multiple tables handling different HR-related aspects such as employees, jobs, departments, attendance, and payroll.  

### **🛠️ Tables in the Database:**  

1. **Employees** – Stores employee details such as name, job ID, department, and salary.  
2. **Jobs** – Defines job roles and their respective salary ranges.  
3. **Departments** – Manages different company departments.  
4. **Attendance** – Keeps track of employees’ monthly attendance.  
5. **Payroll** – Handles employee salary payments.

## **📸 SQL Query Showcase**  
To showcase my SQL skills, I have included **30 sample queries** along with **30 screenshots** displaying their execution and results. These queries demonstrate various SQL concepts such as:  

✔️ Basic SELECT statements  
✔️ Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)  
✔️ Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)  
✔️ GROUP BY & HAVING  
✔️ Subqueries  
✔️ CASE statements  
✔️ Data Manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

## **🎯 Conclusion**  
This project has been a great learning experience in **PostgreSQL database design, query optimization, and real-world HR data handling**. I hope this serves as a basic portfolio project and helps others in learning PostgreSQL!
